Pages:
RecipeListView - Shows a list of all the recipes in a grid format. Three columns of recipe cards
    - On this page you can see each recipe's picture, title, and description
    - You can save the recipe by clicking the star icon
    - You can report a bug or problem with the recipe by clicking the flag icon
    - This view is paginated so you see 24 recipes at a time.
RecipeDetailView - Shows the recipe title, description, ingredients, directions, tags, and similar recipes
    - This page is laid out as two separate containers. The first holds the recipe information and the second contains recipes sharing the same ingredients
    - Each tag is clickable which takes you to another page showing all of the other recipes sharing the same tag
    - As in the ListView, you can save the recipe by clicking the star icon, or report a bug or problem with the recipe by clicking the flag icon
    - Under related recipes, you can view user comments or leave your own.
    - Clicking a tag takes you to another page to see all recipes sharing that tag.
Discover - This page lets you search through recipe titles
    - This page only features a search bar that says "Search Recipes"
    - Upon clicking a tag in DetailView, the similarly tagged recipes appear in the discover view
    - In 4 columns each tag is listed under the search box. Clicking one will take you to another page showing every recipe that shares that tag
SavedRecipes - Shows a list of all of your saved recipes
    - Saved recipes show up in a table and are selectable
    - Upon selection two buttons activate, delete and show ingredients
    - Clicking show ingredients, shows a list of each selected recipe's ingredients in a new list under the ingredients table
    - I would like clicking show ingredients to really be more like a "show grocery list" button where identical ingredients would be combined and it would show the total of each ingredient you need
AddRecipe - Lets you add a new recipe in the same format as the DetailView
    - I've laid this page to look as similar as possible to the DetailView's layout
    - You can add ingredients dynamically and each ingredient in broken up into three inputs. Quantity, Measurement, Ingredient Name
    - Steps can be added dynamically as well and each step is added as one input. 
    - You can select as many tags as you want by typing in a dropdown box
    - Nutrition information can also be submitted for each recipe. I have a form for Calories, # Servings, Fat, Carbohydrates, Protein, Sodium, Fiber, Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, MonoFat, and PolyFat
