## Recipeze
This is the React frontend from my project Recipeze.net. It uses styled components from ant.design and axios to make htttp requests. I'm not pushing the backend because I don't think it'd be very useful for us as it's using Django and we're gonna use Express. Regardless, our project should be structured in roughly the same way. Also, if you're new to React, you can use this as another resource for getting an idea of how it works.

## Usage
To get this up and running on your machine from your command line run:

`git clone https://github.com/Bradleynewlon0214/Recipeze.git && cd Recipeze && cd frontend`

`npm i`

`npm start`


Although, I haven't pushed the backend, the app will pull from a server I already have in production.
